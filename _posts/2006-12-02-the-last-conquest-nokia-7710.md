Now, FontRouter2 is expectatively compatible with all the Symbian phones except those of Symbian 9 (S60v3 and UIQ3). This is definite the binary compatibility with one single binary! (:

Binary compatibility with Symbian 9 could not be achieved because of the break in compiler. As mentioned in SDK document of Symbian 9:
