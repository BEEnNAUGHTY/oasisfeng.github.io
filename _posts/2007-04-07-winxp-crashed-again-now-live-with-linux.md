After some crazy modding of nforce drivers, my WinXP crashed fatally. Even the safe mode is not available&#8230;

I&#8217;ve been seeking for a rescue CD of WinXP, but with no luck. Instead, I found a Ubuntu Linux CD for 64-bit system which is received from my friend. So, I&#8217;m now getting attached to Linux~

It&#8217;s really not that comfortable for me to live with Linux, even Ubuntu gives the perfect experience on installation and user interface. First, I had to find a Chinese input method in order to end up with this messy English writing&#8230; )-X
