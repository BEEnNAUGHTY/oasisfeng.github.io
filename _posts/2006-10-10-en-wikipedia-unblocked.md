[来自cnBeta的消息](http://www.cnbeta.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=16522)：难得GFW如此开恩，可以让我们直接访问[维基百科英文版](http://www.wikipedia.org/)，终于不用再借助WebProxy了。

今天真是一个好日子，看看维基百科英文版的“On this day&#8230;”：

> From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
> 
> **Double Tenth Day** (Traditional Chinese: 雙十節; pinyin: Shuāng Shí Jié) is the national day of the Republic of China (ROC; now in Taiwan) and celebrates the start of the Wuchang Uprising of October 10, 1911 (1911-10-10), which led to the collapse of the Qing dynasty. It is therefore also known in Chinese as **National Celebration Day** (Traditional Chinese: 國慶日; pinyin: Guóqìng Rì).
> 
> In Taiwan, the day typically starts off with a military and public parade through the streets of Taipei and in front of the Presidential Office Building. Later in the day, the President of the Republic of China addresses the country and fireworks displays are held throughout the major cities of the island.
> 
> Outside of Taiwan, Double Tenth Day is also celebrated by many Overseas Chinese communities, such as parades in Chinatowns of San Francisco, California and Chicago, Illinois. However, since the election of Chen Shui-bian as President of the ROC, a growing number of disgruntled Overseas Chinese people have increasingly identified themselves more with the People&#8217;s Republic of China (PRC) and less with the ROC, somewhat lowering the profile of Double Tenth Day in these communities.[citation needed]
> 
> Before the sovereignty of Hong Kong was transferred to the PRC in 1997, many ROC supporters there would display patriotic and colorful flags (mainly the national flag of ROC) to celebrate Double Tenth Day. Since the transfer of sovereignty to the mainland, the anniversary of the Xinhai Revolution continues to be celebrated, but not under the &#8220;Double Tenth Day&#8221; name. Much larger festivities now occur on on October 1, the National Day of the PRC.

真是一个讽刺！;)

虽然中文版仍遭雪冻，不过我却意外的发现了另一个诞生不久的“可爱”的中文版本：<http://zh-classical.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page>

读一读这些“白为文述”的字句，你一定也会不禁捧腹的！:) （注：丙戌年即2006年）
